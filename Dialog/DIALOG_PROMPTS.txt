ENTITY: "Hey."

ENTITY: "Hey, idiot."

ENTITY: "Do you even know were you're going?"
	>SOFT: "I'm fine, I'll figure it out."

ENTITY: "Wow, that's careless."
	>SOFT: "I'll be alright."

-------------

ENTITY: "Running ahead aimlessly. Typical."

ENTITY: "You're going to get us lost. Again."
	>COLD: "Nobody asked for your opinion"
	
ENTITY: "You don't even know where we are. You'll never make it through the night."
	SOFT: "Hardly the first time I slept outdoors."
	>COLD: "Or worse, I'll make it through and you'll still be here."
	
ENTITY: "You'll end up just another girl disappeared in the clouds."
	SOFT: "Don't worry, I'll find my way."
	>COLD: "Why don't you disappear in a crack in the ground and never show your face again?"
	
ENTITY: "You say these things but you don't mean them.
	>SOFT: "I'm quite capable of knowing my own mind."
	COLD: "Oh, I do mean them. Fiercely."


-------------

ENTITY: "Well, that's it. No chance you'll make it through that."
	>AGGR: "Shut the hell up!"
	
ENTITY: "Oh, she's pissed now. Bravo. That's soooo constructive."
	SOFT: "I have good reasons to feel that way."
	COLD: "Not fun to reap what you sow, is it?"
	>AGGR: "Keep that up, I'll show you what destructive looks like!"
	
ENTITY: "Got that out of your system? Little tantrum over?"
	SOFT: "I don't need to justify myself."
	>COLD: "Better to throw tantrums than to end up like you."
	AGGR: "You've seen nothing yet, you little creep!"
	
ENTITY: "You know, if you had self-control, maybe that little mishap back home wouldn't have happened."
	>SOFT: "That's not fair."
	COLD: "Don't you dare bring that up."
	AGGR: "I have the self-control not to blacken your eye!"

ENTITY: "Then again, careful never really was your thing, right?"
	SOFT: "Everyone makes mistakes."
	COLD: "Not careful enough to avoid meeting you, tragically.
	>AGGR: "You be careful what you say if you want to keep your teeth!"
	
ENTITY: "What are you mad at me for? It was your fault."
	SOFT: "I was only trying to help."
	>COLD: "Don't start commenting things you know nothing about."
	AGGR: "You wouldn't recognize fault if I slapped your face with it!"

ENTITY: "So you run away from your problems rather than confront them. So predictable."
	SOFT: "It's better not to cause unnecessary conflicts."
	COLD: "If I wanted to talk about it, I'd go to someone I actually respect."
	>AGGR: "If you insist, I can confront my hand to your head!"
	

-------------

ENTITY: "Come to think of it, you're right. Don't talk about it."

ENTITY: "You'd screw that up like you screw everything up."

ENTITY: "You're a failure. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it."

ENTITY: "That's why none of them will even talk to you anymore."
	SOFT: "We'll mend things eventually."
	COLD: "If only you would do the same."
	AGGR: "

--------------
	
ENTITY: "Admit it : it's better that way."

ENTITY: "If you stayed it would only have become worse for you and them."

ENTITY: "At the end of the day, I'm the only who still wants you around."
	AGGR: "Enough! What are you even doing here?"
	
ENTITY: "Huh?"
	AGGR: "I didn't ask for this! I didn't ask for you to squat into my head!"

ENTITY: "Wow, where's that coming from? I'm only looking out for you."
	AGGR: "And why are YOU so interested in my well-being all of a sudden?"
	AGGR: "You claim they all hate me but you don't know shit about them!"
	AGGR: "You're just glad they stopped talking to me. So it's just you, me, and your dirty tricks!"

"I've had enough of you. I'm going back and I'm going to fix it."

GENERIC: 



ENTITY: "You'll get it. Eventually. Probably not, though."
	SOFT: "I will."
	COLD: "And you'll never get anything from anyone, so how's that?"
	AGGR: "You'll get my fist in your face if you don't quit it!"

ENTITY: "Bet you wish you had listened to me, now."
	SOFT: "I'm in no rush."
	COLD: "No one in their right mind would ever listen to you."
	AGGR: "I wish I could punch your lights out!"
	
ENTITY: "That was just pathetic."
	SOFT: "I can always try again."
	COLD: "No more pathetic than your entire existence."
	AGGR: "You'll look worse when I get my hands on you!"
	
ENTITY: "You only got that far through luck."
	SOFT: "No, I did it by myself."
	COLD: "If I was lucky, I'd never have met you."
	AGGR: "Keep that up and not even luck will save you!"
	
ENTITY: "I wouldn't have done that if I were you."
	SOFT: "I'll get it this time."
	COLD: "And if I were you, I would throw myself off that cliff."
	AGGR: "Can it before I make you!"
